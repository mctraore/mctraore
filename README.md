## Hello there! 👋🏿  
Hi, I'm Marie-Claire—a software developer with a passion for learning new things and coding for social good. I am currently working on SwiftUI, Python, and Javascript projects. I am open to new opportunities!

When I'm not coding, you can find me running or doing yoga 🏃🏿‍♀️🧘🏿‍♀️✨

## ⌨️  #100DaysOfCode
I commited to the #100DaysOfCode challenge to code for a minimum of one hour every day for 100 consecutive days. Check out my [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/mctraore_) to find updates on what I'm currently working on.
