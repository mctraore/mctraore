## Hello there! 👋🏿  
Hi, I'm Marie-Claire—a software developer with a passion for learning new things and coding for social good. I am currently working on SwiftUI, Python, and Javascript projects. I am open to new opportunities!

When I'm not coding, you can find me running or doing yoga 🏃🏿‍♀️🧘🏿‍♀️✨
